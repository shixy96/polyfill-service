	</h1>

	<p>
		The Financial Times provides premium news, insight and analysis to a
		growing audience of global decision makers. We have held true to our
		values of integrity, authority and independence for more than 130 years.
		Central to this mission is our commitment to upholding the highest
		standards of data protection for our customers.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy applies to the <a
		href="https://polyfill.io/">Polyfill.io</a> website (“<em>Site</em>”)
		and the public instance of the Polyfill Service made available by us, as
		described on the Site (“<em>Service</em>”). This Site and the Service
		are referred to together as “<a href="https://polyfill.io/"><em>Polyfill.io</em></a>”.
	</p>
	<p>
		We collect and use personal information in different ways for the Site
		and the Service. This Privacy Policy sets out details of these different
		ways in which we collect and use information.

	<h2 id="what-information-do-we-collect-from-the-service">
		<strong>The Service:</strong> What information do we collect from the Service?
	</h2>

	<p>
		The Service is a hosted instance of software known as Polyfill Service.
		Polyfill Service provides snippets of code, called “polyfills”, that
		allows websites operated by FT and by others to provide a consistent
		experience across different browsers. When you load a web page which
		uses Polyfill Service, your browser will download any polyfills required
		in order to present the web page successfully in your browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to provide the polyfills, the Service receives certain
		technical information from your browser including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>browser details;</li>
		<li>connection details, such as your IP address, which can identify your approximate location and/or name of your ISP;</li>
		<li>the URL of the web page which has made the request to the Service. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We use the above information to determine which polyfills are required
		by your browser. We do not retain this information.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may retain the following information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>obfuscated IP addresses, this is an IP address with the last 3
		digits removed or masked in order to anonymise it;</li>
		<li>the domain of the web page which has made the request to the Service;</li>
		<li>the user agent string for your browser;</li>
		<li>the set of polyfills that were requested by the web page;</li>
		<li>the URL and HTTP method used to access the service.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The information we retain cannot identify you. We retain it in order to
		identify which websites are using the Service and whether any websites
		are abusing the Service.
